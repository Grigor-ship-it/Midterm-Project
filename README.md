Tayst allows users to go through a seamless menu on a SPA and add items to their cart for purchase. User registration, user information edit and log in features are built in with the ideology of producing a very effecient SPA. Our driving force behind the app was the seamlessness and the intuitive nature of the website. 

Tayst offers users an in built direction module for order pickups, an estimated pickup timer and current promotions. Tayst will confirm your orders via 
SMS notifications so you can feel reassured that your order(s) went through. 

## Project Setup

The following steps are only for _one_ of the group members to perform.

1. Create your own copy of this repo using the `Use This Template` button, ideally using the name of your project. The repo should be marked Public
2. Verify that the skeleton code now shows up in your repo on GitHub, you should be automatically redirected
3. Clone your copy of the repo to your dev machine
4. Add your team members as collaborators to the project so that they can push to this repo
5. Let your team members know the repo URL so that they use the same repo (they should _not_ create a copy/fork of this repo since that will add additional workflow complexity to the project)


## Getting Started

1. Create the `.env` by using `.env.example` as a reference: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Update the .env file with your correct local information 
  - username: `labber` 
  - password: `labber` 
  - database: `midterm`
3. Install dependencies: `npm i`
4. Fix to binaries for sass: `npm rebuild node-sass`
5. Reset database: `npm run db:reset`
  - Check the db folder to see what gets created and seeded in the SDB
7. Run the server: `npm run local`
  - Note: nodemon is used, so you should not have to restart your server
8. Visit `http://localhost:8080/`

## Warnings & Tips

- Do not edit the `layout.css` file directly, it is auto-generated by `layout.scss`
- Split routes into their own resource-based file names, as demonstrated with `users.js` and `widgets.js`
- Split database schema (table definitions) and seeds (inserts) into separate files, one per table. See `db` folder for pre-populated examples. 
- Use the `npm run db:reset` command each time there is a change to the database schema or seeds. 
  - It runs through each of the files, in order, and executes them against the database. 
  - Note: you will lose all newly created (test) data each time this is run, since the schema files will tend to `DROP` the tables and recreate them.

## Roadmap

- User will be able to chose menu items depending on category.
- User will be able to search through menu via input in search field.
- User will be able to add a menu item as a favorite for ease of access.
- User will be able to specify specific pickup time for food.
- User will receive notification if specific ingredient is included in a menu item and receive a warning during add-to-cart process for allergens.
- User payment options will be more flexible.
- User will be able to see a list of past orders.
- Admins on website would load a different options such as searchable function to sift through past orders as well as track current orders being processed.
- Admins will be able to send an SMS notification on demand if orders are compeleted before estimated time.
